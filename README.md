Notes:
as of june 4, when i have jus tfinished everything, I think I got a few things wrong. Hopefully someone points them out. I was really consumed to make the knob to control vol or smt. I has js put a normal potentiometer connected to the A0 pin of the XIAO board. Im preatty sure that wont work, but ill eddit it later. After looking at other sudmitions, i see that using something called a rotery enforser was better.
